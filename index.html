<blockquote><p>The NJIT experience offers a unique blend of liberal and
technical education. We offer many opportunities to engage areas beyond typical
engineering, architecture, and science degrees. Opportunities abound for
interdisciplinary learning at the intersections with the humanities, social
sciences and economics, as we help our students to consider where technology is
going to take us as a society locally, regionally, and
globally.</p></blockquote>
